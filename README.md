# üò∑ Face Mask Detection System üò∑

A face mask detection is a system that is capable of detecting if one or more individuals is wearing a face mask. This project recognizes and displays the number of faces detected, the number of peaople wearing the face mask correctly, incorrectly or not in a picture. With the increasing number of COVID-19 victims, it is pivotal to integrate systems capable of detecting people wearing a face mask properly or not, this will help curtail the virus. I humbly ask that we obey the rules set aside and wear face mask correctly to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

## Advantages

This solution provides the following:

- Face mask detection accuracy of 94% 
- Ability to identify multiple people at once in real time.
- Ability to track and identify if the face mask is put on correctly. 

## Business Case
‚Äã
Can be used in Hospitals, Airports, Banks, Schools and Organizations 
## Technical details 

**Input 1 (video or image to process, capable of processing):** ‚Äã‚Äã

- mjpeg stream

- rtsp stream

- USB camera devices

- video files (avi, mp4, mkv formats supported)

- standalone image files (.png, .jpg formats supported)

 

**Input 2:**

Reference images to which the system compares the faces in the image. (.png, .jpg formats supported)


**Outputs:**

- Processed video frame

- The faces in the frame (bounding boxes) showing whether face mask is worn or not.

**For each face:**

- Unique Tracking ID (when processing a video file, the same ID on each frame belongs to the same person)

- The most similar reference face ID

- Degree of similarity to the reference face

- Up to 5 facial landmark points

- The system is able to to write the processed video to a video file.
